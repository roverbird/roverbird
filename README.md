**Summary:** I am interested in cyber security, data science, automation, and DevOps. I am comfortable with server-side development and back-end in python, but I also do front-end UI/UX work. For web, I prefer Bulma CSS, static generators, and vanilla js (simple setups from CDN). With my FreeBSD, Linux and Nginx experience I have knowledge of deployment and server management, and my R skills indicate involvement in data-driven tasks.
